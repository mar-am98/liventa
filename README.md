# 🏠 Liventa

**Liventa** is a full-stack web application inspired by rental and accommodation platforms, built with **Next.js** and **Supabase**.  
The project focuses on real-world functionality, complete user flows, and database-driven features rather than static UI pages.

## 🌟 Inspiration

The visual structure of this project was inspired by publicly available rental platform clone designs.  
The full implementation — including application structure, authentication, database logic, and deployment — was built independently as a learning project.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Building a real full-stack application from development to deployment
- Connecting frontend components to a real database
- Managing authentication and protected routes
- Working with Prisma schemas and queries
- Debugging and improving real application flows
